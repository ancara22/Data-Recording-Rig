Yeah, by you going there, they, people actually reported her to the police for a hate crime just by your presence in that school. That's the problem with hate crime legislation. Like who defines hate? And I know the answer to that, who defines hate? The people? You least want to. So, you know, you want hate crime legislation, you just better keep in mind who's gonna define what constitutes hate. And then you think about the people, you're enabling these rat fins, these people who didn't learn not to uh tattle tail on their peers when they were Children who run to totalitarian authority to wield their resentful power. Now, that's all part of the legal code. It's like, well, we'll see where that goes. Well, we know where it goes, it goes."

One of my favorite movie clips is Rocky Balboa. It's probably the non intellectual version of Jordan Peterson in many ways because he said this to his son. He was getting a bit spoiled and entitled and moaning about being Rocky so as well. And he says this to him. I love those people. It's good. What do you think of it? Well, that ethos was what lifted up Sylvester Stallone to stardom very rapidly in his first movie. And what do I think about that? I think that young people are literally dying for that message. I really, and I mean, literally, they're so demoralized, it's just beyond belief. And so one of the things that's been painful"

And what's the best way for them to come to? Yeah. Well, welcome back to this special edition of Piers Morgan Sense. One on one with Doctor Jordan Peterson. We left them on the cliffhanger with Rocky Balboa and his address to his son about how to grow a pair for want of a better phrase. Um This idea that actually your life is defined not so much by success because you're everyone's friend and you're successful. But by the knocks you inevitably are gonna get, whether it's through losing love, one is losing a job, you know, losing a car, whatever it may be, you're gonna get hit by start recording. I'm feeling very good, stop recording, losing your life with differing magnitude. And I've always believed that how you deal with the, the downside of life really defines how you lead the rest of your life. Well, the, the clip is very interesting because"

But if you let the misery demoralize you and make you bitter and cynical and cowardly and make you withdraw, then first of all, that's a failure in the highest sense on your part and all it's gonna do is make everything worse. And then you might think, well, what do you have to, to, to respond to that? How do you respond to that catastrophe and challenge? And the answer is, and this is what Rocky is telling his son in no uncertain terms is like terrible as things are.

But also a conversation I had with Doctor Phil in America where his explanation for it was that he said, you've got to understand that social media means that young people now are being bombarded all day long and all night long with quite shocking imagery. And he gave an example. He said when I was young, he said, if a crocodile ate somebody on a golf course in Florida, the chances are I would never have heard about it. It probably wouldn't have made the national news, probably wouldn't have even made the state news and I wouldn't have heard about this incident. Now it's quite likely that a video of the crocodile eating this person would be whipping its way around social media within half an hour and"

And no one really knows the answer to that. But we should also point out that it's no wonder that young people are demoralized and anxious because we're doing everything we can to demoralize them and make anxious. So on the masculine front, we tell young boys that well, the world's a terrible patriarchal tyranny and all of that patriarchal tyranny, which is the whole explanation for history has done nothing but oppress and exploit people and destroy the planet.
