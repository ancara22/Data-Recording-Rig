# Blockchain API

## Overview

The Blockchain API is a serverless application built with Express.js and AWS Lambda. It provides a rehashing operation, allowing users to rehash a provided hash value with additional data and store the result in DynamoDB.

## Deployment

The Blockchain API is designed to be deployed on AWS Lambda. Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. **Create an AWS Lambda Function:**

   - Set up an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose the Node.js runtime.
   - Upload your deployment package, including the `blockchain-API.js` file and `node_modules`.

2. **Set Lambda Settings:**

   - Configure environment all necessary settings in the AWS Lambda function.

3. **API Gateway Integration:**

   - Connect the Lambda function to API Gateway to expose your API as an HTTP endpoint.

4. **Permissions:**

   - Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB.

5. **Testing:**

   - Test your API endpoint using the provided routes.

## Usage

Once the Blockchain API is deployed, you can use the provided `/rehash` route to perform the rehashing operation.

## Routes

### `POST /rehash`

Rehashes the provided hash value with additional data and stores the result in DynamoDB.

- **Request:**

  ```json
  {
    "hash": "originalHashValue",
    "user": "associatedUser"
  }


## Serverless
To deploy the blockchain function on AWS Lambda, you need to execute the following commands:

   - npm install -g serverless
   - serverless login //You need a Serverless.com account if you want to deploy it also on serverless.com, or you can omit it.
   - serverless deploy

- **Notice:**
Before deploying the function, make sure to include your AWS credentials in the ~/.aws file or execute:

   - serverless config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
