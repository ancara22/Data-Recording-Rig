## Deployment

The Blockchain API is designed to be deployed on AWS Lambda. Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. **Create an AWS Lambda Function:**

   - Set up an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose the Node.js runtime.
   - Upload your deployment package, including the `blockchain-API.js` file and `node_modules`.

2. **Set Lambda Settings:**

   - Configure environment all necessary settings in the AWS Lambda function.

3. **API Gateway Integration:**

   - Connect the Lambda function to API Gateway to expose your API as an HTTP endpoint.

4. **Permissions:**

   - Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB.

5. **Testing:**

   - Test your API endpoint using the provided routes.

## Usage

Once the Blockchain API is deployed, you can use the provided `/rehash` route to perform the rehashing operation.

## Routes

### `POST /rehash`

Rehashes the provided hash value with additional data and stores the result in DynamoDB.

- **Request:**

  ```json
  {
    "hash": "originalHashValue",
    "user": "associatedUser"
  }
